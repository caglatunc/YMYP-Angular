[image](https://github.com/caglatunc/YMYP-Angular/assets/95507765/218fa8da-fae9-485c-ac6a-ff2992606c73)
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3.

This README file is used to introduce an Angular project that creates a login page. The features of the login page and how to use it are explained below.

## About the Project

This Angular project includes a modern login page design and is developed using **Bootstrap**. Users can enter their username or email address along with their password and log in to the system by clicking the "Login" button.

## Features

- Username or email validation
- Password validation
- Alerts for missing or incorrect data entry (using the Toastr library)

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project in your local environment, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Username/ProjectName.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ProjectName`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the application: `ng serve`

## Usage

The login page allows users to perform identity verification. If the username or email and password are correct, the user can log in to the system.

------------  -------------  -----------------  -------------
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

You can view the login page by going to `http://localhost:4200` in your web browser.
